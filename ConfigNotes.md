- [ ] Look into adding [nvim-treesitter-context](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context) to config.
- [ ] Look into enabling [codecompanion](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main)
    - [ ] Look at this configuration for ideas: [custom config from reddit](https://github.com/oca159/lazyvim/blob/main/lua/plugins/codecompanion.lua)
    - [x] Get copilot free student trial either with my school email or with Chris's.
    - [ ] Add copilot as the chat provider.

    - [ ] Add [colopilot-cmp](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp) to make copilot appear in the autocomplete menu insthead of ghost text.
- [ ] Remove diff window in undotree. This window is the window below the undotree window, it shows the diff between the current state of the file and the last state of the file. Mabye I would use it more in the future, in that case, disregad this
- [ ] Look into mabye adding `nvim-web-devicons` plugin.
- [ ] Look into displaying function information when entering function arguments, this is probably an option in cmp-nvim, lsp-config, or another lsp related configuration.
- [ ] Look into replacing nvim-cmp with [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp).
- [ ] Replace luasnip with built in snippets.
- [ ] Change completion keybinding from `<TAB>` or `<C-a>` to `<C-y>`.

- [ ] Refactor lualine harpoon autocommands following [TJ's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekMIIAqTZ34&list=WL&index=89)
- [ ] Add cutom "bubble theme" to lualine and figure out how to remove the black background from it.
- [ ] Switch ESC and CAPS LOCK key mappings(in mac somehow, its not really related to neovim, but whatever).
- [ ] Add jupyter notebook plugin.
- [ ] Fix wezterm default font size.
- [ ] Figure out how to remove the tab background in Wezterm.
- [ ] Look into adding a window manager for harpoon like movement between apps the best option seems to be: [quick silver](https://github.com/quicksilver/Quicksilver) or [hammer spoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) with [proco spoon window switcher](https://github.com/Porco-Rosso/PorcoSpoon/tree/main) or [app window switcher](https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/AppWindowSwitcher.html#bindHotkeys).
- [ ] Replace fzy-lua with [fzf-native](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim) for telescope.
- [ ] Look into session persistance with [persistence.nvim](https://github.com/folke/persistence.nvim)
- [ ] Add lockfile to version control as specified in [Lockfile usage](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile)
- [ ] Optimize lazy config for a faster startup. Try to get below 70 ms, the more the better though :), Resources: [optimizing startup time reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/117zfq2/optimizing_my_startup_time/).
- [ ] Look at [Auto Debug Print](https://github.com/andrewferrier/debugprint.nvim) for print debugging macros(basically).
- [ ] Replace [trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim) with previous context plugin [treesitter-context](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context)
- [ ] Remove autoformat on save for conform.nvim since "<leader>f" is used for formatting already.
- [ ] See if removing lualine is possible and just having the default statusline but with mode, git branch, file name, current position in file, and harpoon mark indicatior.
- [ ] Look into adding [line number chahnge](https://github.com/sethen/line-number-change-mode.nvim)
- [ ] Remove "<leader>/"(Fuzzily search in current buffer) keybinding as it is unused.
