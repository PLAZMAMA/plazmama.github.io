# Things to Change About My Current Neovim Config
- [ ] Look into replacing harpoon with this plugin: [arrow.nvim](https://github.com/otavioschwanck/arrow.nvim)
- [ ] Change left most section of lualine with the current time. Currently it just show {line_num}:{column_num} which is not very useful
- [ ] Upgrade lazy.nvim
- [ ] Remove unused terminal toggle.
