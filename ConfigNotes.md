    - [ ] Add [colopilot-cmp](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp) to make copilot appear in the autocomplete menu insthead of ghost text.
- [ ] Remove diff window in undotree. This window is the window below the undotree window, it shows the diff between the current state of the file and the last state of the file. Mabye I would use it more in the future, in that case, disregad this
- [ ] Look into mabye adding `nvim-web-devicons` plugin.
- [ ] Look into displaying function information when entering function arguments, this is probably an option in cmp-nvim, lsp-config, or another lsp related configuration.

- [ ] Look into session persistance with [persistence.nvim](https://github.com/folke/persistence.nvim)
- [ ] Add lockfile to version control as specified in [Lockfile usage](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile)
- [ ] Optimize lazy config for a faster startup. Try to get below 70 ms, the more the better though :), Resources: [optimizing startup time reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/117zfq2/optimizing_my_startup_time/).
    - [ ] Lazy load vim-wiki on keymap
    - [ ] Lazy load telescope on keymap
- [ ] Look at [Auto Debug Print](https://github.com/andrewferrier/debugprint.nvim) for print debugging macros(basically).
- [ ] Replace [trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim) with previous context plugin [treesitter-context](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context)
- [ ] Remove autoformat on save for conform.nvim since "<leader>f" is used for formatting already.
- [ ] See if removing lualine is possible and just having the default statusline but with mode, git branch, file name, current position in file, and harpoon mark indicatior.
- [ ] Look into adding [line number chahnge](https://github.com/sethen/line-number-change-mode.nvim)

- [ ] Convert the bindings shown in this video to Lua and add it in the core/keymaps.lua [moving text up and down video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNyNm5DsQ88&t=6s)
- [ ] Remove 90 charater line red text highlight. Think of a less intrusive way to do this, mabye a line at the 80th column like the primeagen's.
- [ ] Update Lazy installation with the non depercated function.
- [ ] Make tiptools transperant with the tokyonight colorscheme.
- [x] Add git commit current file only (gc), git commit all files (gca), push(gp), pull(gpl), git log(gl), and git log local(gll) editor command shortcuts.
- [x] Remove `<leader>pv` as it is redundant to `:Explore`, add command shortcut for `:e .` and `:e current file dir`.
- [x] Switch ESC and CAPS LOCK key mappings(in mac somehow, its not really related to neovim, but whatever).
- [x] Replace fzy-lua with [fzf-native](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim) for telescope.
- [x] Add builtin telescope keymap search by adding the following:
```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>sk', builtin.keymaps, { desc = '[S]earch [K]eymaps' })
```
- [x] Change `<leader>ss` to `<leader>st` (Search Select Telescope).
