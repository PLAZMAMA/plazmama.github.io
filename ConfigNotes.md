- [x] Move LSP diagnostics lualine component to the left side and recalculate the centering algorithm needed.
- [x] Optimize lazy config for a faster startup. Try to get below 70 ms, the more the better though :), Resources: [optimizing startup time reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/117zfq2/optimizing_my_startup_time/).
